Recursion --> Function calling itself

Why recursion?
    It helps us in solving bigger complex problems in simpler way
    We can convert recursion solutions into iterations and vica-versa

Space Complexity:
    not constant because of recursive calls

Visualizing recursion: (VVimp)
    Recursion Tree (screenShot)

Recurrence relation:
    formula in terms of recursion { fibo(n) = fibo(n-1) + fibo(n-2) }

How to approach a problem?
    1. Identify weather u can break the problem into smaller problems.
    2. Form the recurrence relation (if needed)
    3. Draw the recursive tree
    4. About the tree,
        a) See the flow of functions, how they are getting in stack
        b) identify and focus on the left tree calls and right tree calls
        c) Draw the tree and arrows on pen-paper
        d) Use debugger to see the flow
    5. See how the values are returned in each step
    6. See where the function call will come out. In the end, you will come out of the main function
